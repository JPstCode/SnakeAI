# Snake AI

This repository contains Python 3.9 implementations of the classic Snake game and demonstrations of example algorithms, 
including Hamiltonian cycle, A*, and A3C.

## Hamiltonian Cycle

![alt text](docs/Hamiltonian.gif)

Easiest way to win the game is to use hamiltonian cycle. Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop that visits each cell 
exactly once, and returns to starting point [1].

## A*

![alt text](docs/A_star.gif)

A* star is a pathfinding algorithm that finds shortest path from source to goal [2]. 

## Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)

Actor-Critic methods combine value and policy based methods
